William is the titular character of the story.

Lifestlye:

Will lives as a vagabond, travelling around central Texas in his van as it suits him. He doesn't want to be tied down to anything, and this is just his choice on how to live his life, or so he's told himself. He doesn't travel very far, usually centering around one city for a few months at a time. His lifestlye is fairly cheap, and he's been living off a small inheritance from his grandmother for the past several years.

Personality:

Will tends to be fairly rash and impulsive. He doesn't reall "plan" as much as he just "does". It's gotten him into plenty of trouble both before and after his contact with the cold lights. He tends to be very obsessive about certain things. It's useful for getting things done, but his fixations come at a cost to his personal relationships. Will has very few true friends, as he tends to alienate people with his blunt, unapologetic assessment of their lives. Only those who are incredibly patient want to spend time with him, and even then, only for short periods of time.

Abilities:

Suggestion - Will is capable of planting thoughts in others through sheer mental effort. People think it was their idea and act on it as such. Will does NOT, however, have the ability to "read" minds, only to "write" them.

Inflict Pain - Through malicious intent, Will is capable of inflicting great pain on a person. This pain is entirely mental, and produces no lasting physical effects, but with enough, it's possible to "break" a person, mentally. This is likely merely a specific side effect of his base suggestion ability, but it's not known for certain.
