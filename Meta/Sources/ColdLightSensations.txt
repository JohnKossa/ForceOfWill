It’s late, and you’re finding it difficult to keep your eyes open. You really should be getting to sleep, but work needs finishing, and you need to get it done soon. You’ll go to bed as soon as it’s done and-
You must have fallen asleep without noticing because the next thing you know is that your room is full of blinding light that washes away all colour, and you are colder than you ever remember. You gasp, and you can feel the cold inside your lungs, invading every atom of your being with a chill so deep it burns. The light fills your vision and images swirl before your eyes, disjointed and strange.
A man coughing fire, his skin cracking and smoking like lava.
A soft, wet, crunching noise as a man slowly, carefully, pulls the last of his own teeth out - a pair of bloody pliers clutched in one trembling hand.
The screaming as oily darkness seeps from beneath a child’s fingernails, from her eyes and nose and mouth, consuming everything.
Triumphant laughter, from a young woman standing in the rain, blindfolded eyes raised to the sky.
And then, just like that, it’s over. You’re shaking almost uncontrollably, whether from the cold or from shock, you don’t know. Your hands tingle as you place them on your desk to stand up, and then - as if the desk is made of wet clay - and you are left staring in increasing shock and horror at your hands, buried up to the wrists in your very solid desk. You can feel the grain of the wood in your hands, as you slowly pull them back out of your desk and look at them with disbelief.
You - you’re a superhuman? That was a Cold Light?
