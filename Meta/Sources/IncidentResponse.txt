If Something Weird happened (especially if a Cold Light had recently been seen), either the League or the Chiasm Syndicate would send some manner of investigative team to have a poke around. They probably wouldn't have powers, and they'd interview witnesses and so on.

From this, they'd try to work out how dangerous this new superhuman is, and what the nature of their powers are. This might involve the assistance of people like Adamant, who have information-related superpowers that allow them to analyse patterns. Depending on how things looked then, they could send in local superhumans, or maybe from further afield if certain characteristics sound like they'd be needed.
